Nobody would've noticed had director Blake Edwards removed the random, inconsequential character of Mr. Yunioshi, gold digging Holly Golightly's bumbling, annoying Japanese neighbor, but there he is, sticking out like the two-inch buckteeth Mickey Rooney in yellowface sports to complete his look and ensure that the movie, like his portrayal, is ah-so disrespectfur.",

In his depiction of the Crucifixion of Christ—who, coincidentally, is portrayed by white actor Jim Caveziel even though everybody knows Black Jesus was black—the Chosen People are a vile, bloodthirsty horde that takes great pleasure in watching God's son suffer for the sins of man. Gibson gets a gold Star of David for this one—David Duke, that is.",

      "John Hughes' icon of '80s teen cinema is also an icon of American racism, thanks to the infamous exchange student Long Duk Dong. Played by Japanese-American actor Gedde Watanabe, the comic relief role had an entire generation of asshole white kids rolling in the aisles thanks to his drunken school dance antics, emasculating romance, and absurd bastardizations of the English language. We feel sorry for all the Asian kids who got called 'Donger' for a decade after this movie came out. *Gong*",

      "We would call this movie an example of reverse racism at its finest, but that would imply that we condone a certain type of racism, and frankly, it's all the same to us. So when the youngest Wayans brothers donned whiteface to crack some jokes at the expense of white people, we laughed. And laughed again when they sang some Vanessa Carlton.

      "Everyone knows Disney has a long history of racist characters, but nothing is quite as uncomfortable to watch as this long-forgotten tale about post-Civil War plantation life. Despite the attempted message of racial unity (two little white kids make friends with a jolly black storyteller... Hooray!), this mix of live action and animation too easily glosses over the seriousness of the time, thanks to songs like 'Zip-A-Dee-Do-Dah!' There's no way Uncle Remus was that happy.",

      "Toward the end of the first Star Wars trilogy, George Lucas developed a penchant for characters that were more like Muppets than fully fleshed-out characters (i.e., Jabba, Salacious Crumb, the Ewoks). So when it was time to bring back the sci-fi universe, he did himself one better, and developed a penchant for jaw-dropping ethnic stereotypes. From the bumbling carefree Jamaican minstrel (Jar Jar Binks, above) to the hook-nosed shyster merchant (Watto), he outdid any of his Jedi fuckery by a long shot. May the force (of racism) be with you.",

Spoiled white boys need Affirmative Action too! The most racist part about this movie isn't that he's in blackface (although that's pretty fuckin' racist too), it's the fact that we're supposed to believe that everyone else buys it without even questioning why he looks like an Aryan douche covered in shoe polish. Even his black girlfriend, played by miscegenation master Rae Dawn Chong, doesn't catch on after she sees him naked!",

As it stands, though, Griffith’s disturbing “drama” is truly a product of its time of racial injustice, right down to the use of white actors donning black-face makeup while portraying black characters as buffoons whose only goals in life are to try and sleep with white ladies and evade the ever-persistent Ku Klux Klan.",
